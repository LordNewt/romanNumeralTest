# romanNumeralTest
Code kata repo for roman numeral translation


# Purpose

This kata poses the challenge of converting from a roman number (i.e. "I") into decimal (1).  The trick comes from the
"minus" quantities that can appear at times in roman number formats.


# Usage

To play with the conversion classes manually, simply run converter.py.  You will be able to convert back and forth
between decimals and numerals to your heart's content.  Type 'exit' to exit the script.
